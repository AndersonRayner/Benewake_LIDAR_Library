# Benewake LIDAR Tools
Arduino scripts to interface to a Benewake TF03 LIDAR via the CAN interface.

```
WORK IN PROGRESS
```

## Requirements
### Hardware
* Teensy 4.0, though the code is easily portable to other microcontrollers
* Waveshare SN65HVD230 CAN Board, though any compatible CAN transceiver will work

### Software
* FlexCAN_t4 library 
  * Available at `https://github.com/tonton81/FlexCAN_T4`
